  <h1>Cultural Discussion</h1>
  <h2>My take on the fireside chat:</h2>
  <h4>08/20/2015</h4>

      Much of what was discussed here seemed to coincide with my thoughts of how it will be like walk through the doors of Dev Bootcamp, come October. For one, I can absolutely identify with the notion that some are sincerely worried about how they will stack up, or whether or not they will merely be able to grasp the various concepts of software development. I think that Shereef’s response to this idea is encouraging in that he seems very confident that the people that have made it through the admissions process are capable. I like the emphasis on concentrating on developing or fostering a hunger to learn, rather than worrying about how much you currently know.

      I like the idea of concentrating on the more social aspects of software development. It seems that Dev Bootcamp has identified this sort of hidden art in how to teach people to work together and I am very much looking forward to putting that into practice. I also like the idea of students constantly learning from each other and having techniques and best practices spread throughout the cohort. I like the idea of discussing the importance of emotional empathy and things such as race, gender, etc. because I feel that as a culture there is a real lack of understanding when it comes to these issues. I look forward to engaging as someone with a Sociology and History background, and of course given my personal experience in order to add something to the discussion.

      I don’t know that my expectations have changed much, I think the video is in line with what I have come to expect from Dev Bootcamp, which by the way, is a very positive thing. I am both excited and nervous at the idea of learning so much in such a short amount of time.
