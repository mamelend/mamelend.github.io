    <h3>The Fireside Chat:</h3>
    <h4>08/20/2015</h4>
      <p>
      Much of what was discussed today seems to coincide with my previous thoughts on walking through the doors of Dev Bootcamp, come October. For one, I can  identify with being worried about how I will stack up, whether or not I'll be able to grasp the various concepts of software development. I think that Shereef’s response to this idea is encouraging in that he seemed very confident that those who make it through the admissions process are capable. I like the emphasis on concentrating on developing or fostering a hunger to learn, rather than worrying about how much you currently know.

      I also like the idea of concentrating on the more social aspects of software development. It seems that Dev Bootcamp hones in on the hidden art of teaching others to work cooperatively, and I am very much looking forward to putting that into practice. The idea of students sharing techniques and best practices, and in turn having them spread throughout the cohort sounds facinating. I look forward to discussing the importance of emotional empathy, and issues such as race and gender, because I feel that as a culture there is a real lack of understanding when it comes to these issues. I'm eager to engage as someone with a sociology and history academic background, in order to hopefully add something beneficial to the discussion.

      I don’t know that my expectations have changed much, I think the video is in line with what I have come to expect from Dev Bootcamp. I am both excited and nervous at the idea of learning so much in such a short amount of time.
