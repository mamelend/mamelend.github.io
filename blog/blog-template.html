<!--
	How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
	
	We didn't do much wireframing, we decided to go with the template I put together during assignment 2.4.

	Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
	
	Quite! It gave us a simple solid structure to try and build.

	What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

	We decided to keep it simple, especially since we wont be doing too much styling. We decided it was a good idea to use <div> to divide up the sections.
	
	What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
	I hadn't used <div> too much, most of the other things we've gone over a bit. We also through in some horizontal rules to seperate sections visually.
