 <h3>Diversity in Tech, or lack thereof.</h3>
    <h4>09/14/2015</h4>
      <p>
        While the 2010 US Census finds that Blacks and Latinos comprise 12.21% and 16.35% of the population of the United States, respectively, 2014 EEO reports from large tech companies are hiring these groups at an average 7% and 8%, about half as many as the data would suggest. Also, this doesn’t account for the large groups of undocumented Caribbean and Central American persons that form a vital part of the US workforce. Also to consider, while those number may not seem that disparaging, the statistics for those in leadership positions is significantly worse at 2% and 3% for the aforementioned groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        This lack of diversity isn’t only limited to race, there is also a huge gender gap. Women are represented by only 29% of the workforce, and only make up 18% of those in leadership positions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Studies such as the one conducted by USA Today found that universities are graduating Black and Latino computer science and computer engineering students at double the rate that leading technology companies hire them. Other studies point to a significant amount of tech/STEM jobs that remain either unfilled, or must be outsourced due to a “lack of qualified candidates”. This suggests that hiring in the tech industry isn’t only a pipeline issue, but also a cultural issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2015, many top tech companies such as Pinterest and Intel, have acknowledged their poor performance on diversity and pledged to meet certain goals, while outlining other steps taken to change the culture of their organizations. Perhaps the most recent (as of Sept 11 2015) is the Tech Inclusion conference that took place over this past weekend, which included Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Yelp. Also, the White House administration has formed several initiatives such as TechHire and #yeswecode that aim to get more women and underrepresented groups into the industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from the political realm and private industry, a sort-of grassroots movement has formed like with the “#ilooklikeanengineer” twitter hashtag trend aimed to show that the group is an increasingly diverse bunch.
      </p>
      <p>
        The great news is that the hardest part of the solution is complete. Companies are publishing data and have already admitted that there are clear disadvantages to not having a diverse workforce. I think that some other solutions include for the most part restructuring of existing systems and paradigms. Outside firms should be hired to do thorough assessments of the culture of the organizations in order to properly diagnose issues without bias. Companies should mandate recurring training in unconscious bias for all employees. Companies could also offer mentoring and coaching programs for women and minorities once they are hired in order to help them maximize their potential and aim for leadership positions. I think the industry should also consider cultural awareness events that would allow people to engage on their similarities and differences, in order to move beyond stereotyping and othering. Appointing people of color and women to leadership positions would also send a clear message that goes beyond just talking about the issues.
