**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**

*What can I say about CSS, and it's padding, borders and margin properties? I was about to ingrain the key function of each, and gained some expereince in how the work in relation to one another. There is so much more to learn. Trial and error was the name of the game until I began to gain some confidence in what my changes would do before I implemented them. *

**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**

*Positioning was probably the most challenging of all because setting an element to fixed or absolute when it was previously in normal flow, moves the rest of the pages elements up, as if it were never there. You always have to be conscious of what positioning can do to the document as a whole. *

**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**

*Positioning and display gave me the most trouble, styling text and images wasn't too difficult. *

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**

*I learned about using chrome devtools to play around with changes before you made any permanent ones.  This helped me rethink my whole approach to how elements were positioned on the page.*
